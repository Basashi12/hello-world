# hello_world

This is KT12's first repository on Github.  It contains programs in various languages that will output, "Hello, World!" when run.

This includes programs written in [Python](https://github.com/KT12/hello_world/blob/master/hello_world.py), [R](https://github.com/KT12/hello_world/blob/master/hello_world.R), [Octave/Matlab](https://github.com/KT12/hello_world/blob/master/hello_world.m), among other languages.

The reason for this repo is to write very easy code in various languages that I am learning or hope to learn in the future.
